React Material Design Components
===
Material design components written with React.js and React Style.

Thanks to the Polymer team for providing a base set of elements that I could re-implement.

Motivation
---
To experiment with React Style and see what works and what doesn't.

Current issues
---
- Need to implement a base set of components: button, checkbox, radiobutton and tabs
- Use Google Closure Compiler Advanced Mode for bragging rights
- Properly implement the "theming" of the components
- Should work in IE8 whereby the functionality should not be broken
