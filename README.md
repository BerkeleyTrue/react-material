React Material Design Components
===
Material design components written with React.js and React Style.

Thanks to the Polymer team for providing a base set of elements that I could re-implement.

Contributions are very welcome.

Motivation
---
A good starting point for web apps styled with [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), but also to experiment with
[React Style](https://github.com/SanderSpies/react-style/) and see what works and what doesn't.

Current issues
---
- Need to implement a base set of components
- Use Google Closure Compiler Advanced Mode for bragging rights
- Properly implement the "theming" of the components
- Should work in IE8 whereby the functionality should not be broken
- Properly handle mobile interfaces with proper touch support
