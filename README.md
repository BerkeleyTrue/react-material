React Material Design Components
===
Material design components written with React.js and React Style.

Thanks to the Polymer team for providing a base set of elements that I could re-implement.

Contributions are very welcome!

Definitely not production ready for now!

Motivation
---
A good starting point for web apps styled with [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), but also to experiment with
[React Style](https://github.com/SanderSpies/react-style/) and see what works and what doesn't.

Run
---
- git clone https://github.com/SanderSpies/react-material.git
- git submodule init
- git submodule update
- npm install
- webpack
- open index.html
- enjoy
- and contribute


Current issues
---
- [ ] Need to implement a base set of components
- [ ] Properly implement the "theming" of the components
- [ ] Should work in IE8 whereby the functionality should not be broken. IE in general needs some extra work, but so far the results have been promising. Also, for IE8 we need to generate PNG's from the SVG's.
- [ ] Properly handle mobile interfaces with proper touch support
- [ ] Use Google Closure Compiler Advanced Mode for bragging rights
